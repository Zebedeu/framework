# PHP Aplication Distribution Licensing

## What is PADL

A class to generate and validate licenses for a domain, restricting
an expire date.

## Demo and API

*   [PADL Demo](http://padl.rgou.net)
*   [PADL API](docs/README.md)


## History

PADL is a originaly written in 2005 by Oliver Lillie under older PHP4,
parked on PHPCLASSES site. You can find the original code as part as
this distribution or directelly in
[PHP-Generate-PHP-application-license-keys](http://www.phpclasses.org/package/2298-PHP-Generate-PHP-application-license-keys.html).

You can see a quote about:

    There are several solutions to help developers protecting the PHP software
    of applications that they want to sell.

    Usually the developers provide license keys with their software
    that include information about the licensed code, enabled features,
    authorized configuration of the environment on which it is being installed.

    This helps the developers to limit the scope of usage of their
    software according to the type of software license that their clients purchase.

    This way the developers can use the same software distribution
    for different configurations and prices and even trial versions.

    This class provides a means to generate license keys that include encrypted
    information about the clients PHP environment and even a way to send the keys
    to the developers site so they can capture the client features and generate
    upgraded keys that can enable more features for clients that pay the upgrade price.

    Manuel Lemos (PHPCLASSES manteiner)

When I need to licence a PHP project, found this class and as it was so well
written, it was very easy to update it to PH 5.2 and 5.3.

You can find more about the original author in:

*   [PHP CLASSES: Classes of Oliver Lillie](http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/author/122732.html)

*   [PHP CLASSES: Professional profile of Oliver Lillie](http://www.phpclasses.org/professionals/profile/9072/)

*   Otherwise a lot of modifications has been made, all core methods and
    examples are or just a copy or strongly based on the original project.

## TODO

A validator server is not yet implemented - code was not converted to PHP 5.2 and 5.3 -
but in fact it could be done very easily with a webservice.

## Instaling

```bash
composer require rafaelgou/padl
```

## Usage

On `examples` directory there are a many examples of basic usage.
Run the examples under a web server.

To test under a localhost, use the parameter *allowLocal=True*.

To generate and validate the license the code *MUST BE* and *MUST RUN*
under the domain to be validated.

You can store the license in a file, database, or even remotely.

### Generate

```php
<?php
/*
Instance of License
parameters:
- useMcrypt
- useTime
- useServer
- allowLocal
*/
$padl = new Padl\License(true, true, true, true);

//For better security injecting a copy of $_SERVER global var
$server_array = $_SERVER;
$padl->setServerVars($server_array);

$date_expire = '12/31/2011';
list($month, $day, $year) = explode($date_expire);
// Calculating the time offset (expire_in)
$now       = mktime(date('H'), date('i'), date('s'), date('m'), date('d') , date('Y'));
$dateLimit = mktime(23, 59, 59, $month, $day, $year);
$expireIn  = $dateLimit - $now;

// Generating a key with your server details
$license = $padl->generate('localhost', 0, $expire_in);

// Save the license anywhere, database, filesystem, even remotely
```

### Validate

```php
<?php
/*
Instance of License
parameters used in this sample:
- useMcrypt  = false
- useTime    = true
- useServer  = false
- allowLocal = true
*/
$padl = new PadlLicense(true, true, true, true);

// For better security injecting a copy of $_SERVER global var
$server_array = $_SERVER;
$padl->setServerVars($server_array);

// get the license from a form, or load from database, filesystem
$license = (... load the license ...);

// the set key is the key validated
$results = $padl->validate($license);
```
